    <h2>The Question</h2>
    <p>
      Teams disagreed on whether proactive scam warnings would reassure
      users or increase anxiety. The core question was whether messaging
      could prevent harm without eroding trust.
    </p>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Why It Mattered</h2>
    <p>
      Poorly timed warnings risked both user harm and disengagement.
      Over-warning could train users to ignore critical signals,
      while under-warning exposed them to financial loss.

    <h2>Constraints & Tradeoffs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited time before regulatory review</li>
      <li>No historical behavioral data on scam exposure</li>
      <li>Could not run live A/B tests at this stage</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Method Selection</h2>
    <p>
      We needed to understand emotional reactions and mental models,
      not optimize copy. We chose early concept testing with interviews
      to surface thresholds of concern and language sensitivity.

    <h2>What We Found</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Users distinguished between “alerts” and “education”</li>
      <li>Timing mattered more than wording</li>
      <li>Overly authoritative language reduced perceived agency</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The team shifted from persistent alerts to contextual education.
      Messaging guidelines were adopted across future security features.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This study reinforced how easily well-intentioned safeguards
      can undermine trust when emotional context is ignored.
