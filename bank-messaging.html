    <h2>The Need</h2>
    <p>
      The experience design, marketing, and fraud departments were looking
      to increase digital customer engagement by fostering 
      credibility in our messages. 
      The core question was how our communications
      could prevent harm without eroding trust.

    <h2>Why It Mattered</h2>
    <p>
      Poorly timed warnings risked both user harm and disengagement.
      Over-warning could train users to ignore critical signals,
      while under-warning exposed them to financial loss.

    <h2>Constraints & Tradeoffs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited time before regulatory review</li>
      <li>No historical behavioral data on scam exposure</li>
      <li>Could not run live A/B tests at this stage</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Method Selection</h2>
    <p>
      We needed to understand emotional reactions and mental models,
      not optimize copy. We chose early concept testing with interviews
      to surface thresholds of concern and language sensitivity.

    <h2>What We Found</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Users distinguished between “alerts” and “education”</li>
      <li>Timing mattered more than wording</li>
      <li>Overly authoritative language reduced perceived agency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The team shifted from persistent alerts to contextual education.
      Messaging guidelines were adopted across future security features.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This study reinforced how easily well-intentioned safeguards
      can undermine trust when emotional context is ignored.
