    <h2>Needs and Goal</h2>
    <p>
      The experience design, marketing, and fraud departments partnered
      to revamp our messaging strategy. With over 30 different types of communications
      around fraud, we needed to standardize our approach in order to
      increase customer engagement and message credibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Business Goal</b> Reduce false verification rates (where customers
      answer that a transaction is valid before filing a claim), 
      and reduce customers scammed.

    <h2>Why It Mattered</h2>
    <p>
      Fraud and scams cost customers and the bank billions of dollars.
      Our digital communications are the first line between customers' money
      and bad actors; they need to be simple to read and respond to. 
      We set out to define a strategy for successful scam messaging.

    <h2>Constraints & Tradeoffs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited resources for scope of project</li>
      <li>Sparse historical data on urgency and mindsets</li>
      <li>Could not run live tests at this stage</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Method Selection</h2>
    <p>
      I conducted <i>competitive research</i> and <i>stakeholder interviews</i> 
      in order to define the research scope. During this stage, 
      I realized we needed a better understanding of emotional reactions 
      and mental models, instead of the planned quantitative measurement 
      of copy performance. It was time for a pivot.
      <br>First, I defined four message dimensions for investigation:
      Clarity, Trust, Urgency, and Action. I drafted a "menu",
      listing potential studies based on their outcomes and time requirements. 
      <br>Finally, I held a workshop to align partner expectations 
      around results and timing, where we settled on the plan I recommended:
    </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Click test</i> with simulated urgency to inform a design decision
        and provide additional direction 
        for the follow-up study</li>
      <li>
        <i>Lean think-aloud study</i> that would provide valuable behavioral
        insights, without the time commitment of scheduling
        interviews.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Found</h2>
    <p>
      How to connect to dimensions here...
      As expected, the dimensions overlapped when it came to mental models.
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Customers primarily look for consistency cues as well as personal 
          details when they decide to trust a message outside of their account. 
          Yet scam education subconsciously contributes to trust. 
          In the words of a participant,
          "A scammer wouldn't tell you that".
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Customers are less likely to trust or act on a message when:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        they don't recognize a listed transaction or detail
        </li>
        <li>
          there's an unverified path - whether that's a link or phone number
        </li>
        <li>
          they're not sure what's going to happen
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The team shifted from persistent alerts to contextual education.
      Messaging guidelines were adopted across future security features.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This study reinforced how easily well-intentioned safeguards
      can undermine trust when emotional context is ignored.
