    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Fraud and scams cost people billions of dollars. 
      Digital bank communications are the first line between customers' money
      and bad actors. They need to be easy to read, and natural to respond to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experience design, marketing, and fraud departments partnered
      to define our messaging strategy. With over 30 different types of communications
      around fraud, it was time to standardize our approach in order to
      increase customer engagement and message credibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Research Goal:</b> Understand how customers evaluate 
      message trustworthiness to reduce false verification rates 
      and prevent scam losses.
    </p>

    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited resources for scope of project</li>
      <li>Sparse historical data on urgency and mindsets</li>
      <li>Could not run live tests at this stage</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      After competitive research and stakeholder interviews, I made the decision
      to pitch a new approach. Our planned quantitative copy testing aligned with 
      the marketing team's approach, but I knew it would not give us
      the results we needed: What message components actually drive trust?
      <p>
        I defined four key dimensions (Trust, Clarity, Urgency, Action), 
        then created a research "menu" for stakeholders that outlined study options 
        with timing and outcomes. In an alignment workshop, we agreed on:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Click test</b> that simulated urgency for a quick design decision
        and initial direction</li>
      <li>
        <i>Lean think-aloud study</i> for behavioral insights without scheduling
        time overhead
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Customers automatically categorize scam-related communications as urgent. </p>
    <p>We need to ensure that we increase trust through consistent cues and consequences, 
      personal details, and scam education, or users will not trust or respond 
      to our messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strongest trust signals are:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consistent grammar and design
        </li>
        <li>Parity across platforms
        </li>
        <li>
        Sender identity (more common for emails)
        </li>
        <li>Subconsciously: scam education and warnings. 
          In the words of a participant,
          "A scammer wouldn't tell you that".
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Customers are less likely to trust or act on a message when:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        They don't recognize a listed transaction or detail
        </li>
        <li>
          There's an unverified path - whether that's a link or phone number
        </li>
        <li>
          They're not sure what's going to happen
        </li>
      </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      This project is still in the funding process and will undergo 
      further evaluative research. Looking forward,
      the proposed strategy centers around consistent sender identity, 
      enhanced transaction details, and multiple secure messages 
      and verification paths. 
      Thanks to the results on text 
      messages, the team will pursue a partnership to 
      improve sender verification for this channel. 
      Overall,
      designs and copy will communicate the transaction, personal details, 
      and action consequences clearly as well as brief scam education.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If I were to do this project again, I would set out to define 
        the dimensions of a successful communication earlier.
