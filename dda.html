    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      The company was considering taking on a new vendor  
      to provide a white-labeled experience with a variety of features. 
      Stakeholders needed to understand the usability and branding strengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research would help the two companies make decisions on their partnership. 
      The evaluative results were intended to provide insights on where my company 
      should push for design customization.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Research Goal:</b> Uncover how our customers  
      interact with a proposed new feature in order to inform a vendor partnership.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The vendor templates were limited on design changes</li>
      <li>My company’s platforms had technological and implementation limitations</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Approach</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
        The complexity of the requirements led me to recommend and conduct in-depth 
        interviews 
      </li>
        <li>
          I partnered with a designer to build a medium fidelity prototype 
          to capture the possible integration between our platforms and the new feature
        </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Our customers identified the experience as “belonging” to our company. 
      They were able to successfully locate and use the new features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Participants expected to locate a certain vendor feature where 
        they typically use a similar bank feature.
      </li>
      <li>
        One of the features was not intuitive due to the layout design.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      The success of the feature led to feature adoption and a lasting company partnership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our findings led to productive discussions with the vendor. 
      They were able to accommodate design changes around many of the 
      design limitations we documented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to technical constraints, the company was not able to implement 
      a location for the feature that would meet the participant expectations 
      in our study. We are intending to track customer feedback upon release.
    </p>

   <section class="fade-up">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This study reminded me of an important lesson: sometimes you have to compromise on an 
      idealized user experience to get a product to release.
